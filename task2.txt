// Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript \\

~> Objects are important data types in javascript. 
~> Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
~> Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
~>These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

>> Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCarrier = new Object();

myCarrier.course
Output is MERN


myCarrier[institute]       //These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

Output is Guvi
