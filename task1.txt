// Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 \\

>> The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. 
Because it went through several stages of development, 
this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still use on the web.

>> In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 solves several problems that creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate.

>> HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1 and
HTTP/2 is faster in how it prioritizes content during loading Process.

>> HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
it blocks all the other resources behind it.
 HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once 
so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

>> HTTP/1.1 each request had to wait for a response before the next request Could be sent. 
HTTP/2 uses multiplexing to allow multiple concurrent requests and responses over a single TCP Connection.

>> The major feature differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer. 
Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer.

>> This layer encapsulates messages — converted to its binary equivalent — 
while making sure that its HTTP semantics(method, details, header Information, etc) remain Untamed.
